# String+Japanese  

This is a simple library for converting Japanese text. It is based upon [https://github.com/00StevenG/NSString-Japanese](https://github.com/00StevenG/NSString-Japanese) but has been rewritten for the Swift Package Manager.  

It allows _simple_ conversions to and from:  

- Latin Alphabet
- Katakana
- Hiragana
- Kanji (May not be the reading you were expecting!!)
